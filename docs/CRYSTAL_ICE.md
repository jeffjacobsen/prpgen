# PRPGen ICE - Integrated Context Engineering

## What is PRPGen ICE?

PRPGen ICE is an enhanced fork of PRPGen that transforms AI-assisted development through **Integrated Context Engineering**. It provides developers with powerful tools to create, manage, and utilize rich contextual information when working with Claude Code.

## The ICE Philosophy

**Integrated Context Engineering** is based on three core principles:

1. **Context is King**: The quality of AI assistance directly correlates with the quality of context provided
2. **Structure Enables Scale**: Well-structured prompts and documentation enable longer, more complex development sessions
3. **Independence Matters**: Context should be reusable across projects and sessions

## Key Features

### Product Requirement Prompts (PRPs)
- Structured templates that guide AI through complex development tasks
- AI-powered generation using Claude Code
- Version control and history tracking
- Reusable across multiple sessions and projects

### Web Documentation Import
- Intelligent web scraping with crawl4ai
- Single page, recursive, and sitemap crawling modes
- Automatic content extraction and formatting
- Progress tracking for long-running imports

### Context-First Architecture
- Documents and PRPs exist independently of projects
- Mix and match context sources for each session
- Build a library of reusable context over time
- Share context across teams and projects

### Streamlined Workflow
- PRP selection integrated into session creation
- Step-by-step interfaces for complex operations
- Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load
- Focus on the development task, not the tooling

## Why "ICE"?

- **Integrated**: All context sources work together seamlessly
- **Context**: Rich, structured information that guides AI assistance
- **Engineering**: Professional-grade tools for serious development

PRPGen ICE helps you break through the barriers of AI-assisted development by providing the context Claude needs to understand your project deeply and assist effectively.
