## Current State 🎯

### What Works Now:
1. **Complete PRP workflow** - select PRP in session creation dialog
2. **Comprehensive execution process** - structured prompt template guides Claude
3. **PRPs included in Claude Code context** with full content formatting
4. **Full PRP management system** with search, preview, and selection
5. **Document system backend** ready for UI connection
6. **Claude Code integration** for AI-assisted PRP generation
7. **Welcome screen** with Claude setup and testing
8. **Clean fork** without version updates or Discord popups
9. **Streamlined session creation** with improved UX and focused interface

### What's Missing:
1. **Document search/management UI** not built (backend ready)
2. **Session metrics** not tracked
3. **Session comparison tools** not started

## Next Steps 🚀

### Phase 3 Completion:
1. **Build Document Search UI** to replace old StravuFileSearch
